\begin{abstract}
Natural language processing is hard but it is even harder for so-call low-resource languages where the annotated resource are very limited. 
In this thesis, we investigate on methods to overcome the lack of annotated data using complementary resources such as parallel data, dictionary, 
or language relatedness information in the transfer learning setting. We observed consistent improvement on low-resource POS tagging and 
dependency parsing in both semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. We also investigate on a better way to do lexical transfer learning using 
crosslingual word embeddings showing positive result on unsupervised crosslingual document classification and dependency parsing. The approach, 
we took to process low-resource languages is in decreasing the resource dependence. We start with semi-supervised learning and then unsupervised learning. 
In the extreme case, we propose a method to learn from unwritten languages. We show that meaningful relations can be learn directly between speech signal 
in low-resource language and the translation in the target higher resource language.
